# TOGAF Content Metamodel Ontology

OWL version of the TOGAF Content Metamodel.

## Origins and Existing Work

Original from https://sites.google.com/site/ontologyprojects/home/togaf-core-content-metamodel is used with permission from Aurona Gerber. Subsequent modifications are released with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.

Based on the paper [Towards the Formalisation of the TOGAF Content Metamodel using Ontologies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220708864_Towards_the_Formalisation_of_the_TOGAF_Content_Metamodel_using_Ontologies) by Aurona Gerber, Paula Kotze and Alta van der Merwe which is using [TOGAF 9 Content Metamodel](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap30.html).

A regulatory impact analysis solution based on the ontology was presented at the [Semantic Web London](https://www.meetup.com/semantic-web-london/) meetup. Source code is available on https://github.com/cadmiumkitty/ontologies-for-enterprise-architecture and the slides are https://www.slideshare.net/EugeneMorozov/documenting-enterprise-architectures-using-ontologies.

## Immediate Next Steps

Ontology needs to be upgraded to support TOGAF 9.2 with added `category` links to SKOS and `decomposition`. We'd also like to include SKOS version of the concepts and add [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) mappings.
